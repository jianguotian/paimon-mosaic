# Release tools

Release automation requires Python 3.11 or newer. The published Python
binding has a separate runtime floor of Python 3.9.

## Local Java Nexus staging

Java release signing and Nexus deployment run only on the Release Manager's
trusted machine. Start from a clean detached checkout of the RC tag and use the
exact successful top-level `Release` workflow run:

```bash
./tools/deploy_java_staging.sh \
  --release-version 0.3.0 \
  --rc 1 \
  --run-id 12345678901 \
  --dry-run
```

After the dry run succeeds, repeat without `--dry-run`, supplying the Maven
settings and exact signing-key fingerprint:

```bash
./tools/deploy_java_staging.sh \
  --release-version 0.3.0 \
  --rc 1 \
  --run-id 12345678901 \
  --maven-settings deploysettings.xml \
  --gpg-keyname FULL_GPG_FINGERPRINT
```

The script binds the local tag to the workflow run SHA/ref, rejects replacement
refs, special Git index flags, and any dirty or ignored worktree content, then
builds from an isolated archive of the tag. It downloads only the run's
`java-release-native-inputs` by immutable artifact ID, verifies the GitHub
artifact SHA-256 digest, validates the exact four native binaries with the
repository's `tools/native_binary.py` verifier, and relies on the Maven
`release` profile to verify the JARs before signing and deployment in the same
lifecycle. If a workflow rerun leaves multiple unexpired artifacts with that
name, the script lists their immutable IDs, timestamps, and digests and refuses
to guess; inspect the candidates and delete the unintended artifacts before
staging. Real deployment always reads the run from `github.com`, clears ambient
Maven/JVM option variables before invoking Maven, requires a full signing-key
fingerprint present in the ASF Paimon `KEYS` file, and verifies the generated
Maven signatures against that exact fingerprint.

## Dependency and artifact licensing

The committed lockfile freezes the dependency closure used by source, Rust,
Java, and Python release artifacts. Install the pinned generators and refresh
the checked-in dependency and binary-license reports with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny --version 0.19.0 --locked
cargo install cargo-about --version 0.9.1 --locked
cargo fetch --locked
python3 tools/dependencies.py generate
python3 tools/generate_license_reports.py
```

CI verifies that the reports still match `Cargo.lock`:

```bash
python3 tools/dependencies.py check
python3 tools/generate_license_reports.py --check
```

Before signing or publishing a tag, verify that the Java, Rust, Python, and
lockfile versions all match the intended release:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_release_versions.py 0.3.0
```

Release CI also downloads the Apache Paimon `KEYS` file into an isolated GPG
keyring and validates the Git tag:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_release_tag.py v0.3.0-rc1 --keys-file /path/to/KEYS
python3 tools/validate_release_tag.py v0.3.0 --keys-file /path/to/KEYS
```

Tags must be canonical signed annotated tags. A final `vX.Y.Z` tag is accepted
only when it points to the same commit as at least one valid signed
`vX.Y.Z-rcN` tag.

The Java binary JAR carries all four target-specific reports. Sources and
javadoc JARs retain only the source LICENSE and NOTICE. Each Python wheel
carries exactly one target report and installs its legal files both in the
`mosaic` package and in the standard `.dist-info/licenses/` directory. PyPI
publishing is intentionally wheel-only; the signed ASF tarball is the source
release.

Release workflows verify assembled artifacts with:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_java_jars.py \
  --main MAIN.jar --sources SOURCES.jar --javadoc JAVADOC.jar \
  --require-all-natives
python3 tools/verify_python_wheels.py --require-all-targets dist/*.whl
```

The Maven `release` profile runs the Java verifier with
`--require-all-natives` during `verify`, before GPG signing. Release managers
must therefore use one `mvn clean deploy -Prelease` lifecycle rather than
verifying one build and deploying a rebuilt set of JARs.

Source archives are created and checked against an exact Git commit with the
shared path exclusions in `verify_source_archive.py`:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_source_archive.py create \
  --repository . --commit HEAD \
  --prefix paimon-mosaic-0.3.0/ \
  --output /tmp/apache-paimon-mosaic-0.3.0-src.tgz
python3 tools/verify_source_archive.py verify \
  --repository . --commit HEAD \
  --prefix paimon-mosaic-0.3.0/ \
  --archive /tmp/apache-paimon-mosaic-0.3.0-src.tgz
```

Final registry publication uses `verify_registry_artifacts.py` after fetching
the version JSON from PyPI or crates.io. Existing files are accepted only when
their SHA-256 digests match the local release artifacts exactly; PyPI uploads
are staged with only the missing wheels.
